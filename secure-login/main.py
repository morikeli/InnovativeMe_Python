"""
    This script is inspired by an episode I watched in the "Salvation" TV series where a whistleblower tried to access a government institutional system to make confidential info. public because the general public was not aware of the impending danger that could be the end of the world.
    Everytime he entered an incorrect password the system will delay the next login prompt.
