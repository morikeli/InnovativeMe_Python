# Scripts vault

### Repo overview
This is a repo that contains all Python scripts that have written when I began studying Python. GUI apps are also included in the repo.

### Instructions
  - Install Python interpreter in your machine if Python is not installed in your machine. You can download the interpreter from [Python website](https://www.python.org)
  - Once installed, you can check Python version using the following command on your terminal/command prompt/powershell
    - `python --version` and press `Enter`. The Python version will be displayed.
  - Create a folder on your Desktop or preferred location.
  - Download and install Git from [Git website](https:git-scm.com).
  - Open the folder you created in step 3 on your terminal. You can also open it using your preferred code editor, e.g. VS Code. If you have opened the folder using VS Code, open terminal using keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + ~`.
  - Clone this repository into your folder using `git clone https://github.com/morikeli/scripts-vault.git` command.
  - After the cloning process, you can run the scripts.
